## Introduction to Unreal
Familiarity with some of the foundational components of Unreal Engine 4 and experience in virtual reality.

Content:
* Navigate through a game world in the Viewport
* Place an actor in the world using the Content Browser or Place Mode
* Change an actor’s position, scale, and rotation as well as edit other attributes in the Details panel
* Use lights to better illuminate game world
* Change a Static Mesh’s material
* Create Material Instances

Levels:
* Scale (HW_Scale)
  * The relative size of objects in a VR scene can have a powerful effect on the viewer. 
  When immersed in a stereoscopic environment, 
  the viewer is able to infer more about scale because the environment is rendered for each eye at slightly different positions.
    This level uses scale in a meaningful way, by making the viewer feeling small.
* Rotational Degrees of Freedom (HW_Rotation)
  * The headset tracks three rotational degrees of freedom: pitch, yaw, and roll. 
    With this information, the headset can provide a more immersive environment as the viewer rotates.
    This level inspires the viewer to rotate.
* Translational Degrees of Freedom (HW_Translation)
  * The headset also tracks three translational degrees of freedom: up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. 
    With this information, the headset can provide a more immersive environment as the viewer moves in position.
    This level inspires the viewer to move their head.
* Dark forest (HW_MyVR)

Overall grade:

## Blueprinting
Building actors with defined behaviour.

Content:
* Using Blueprints as a way to define the look and behavior of a type of actor.
* Scripting using UE4’s visual scripting language.
* Enriching experience with audio and particle emitters
* Using vector math to manipulate actors in 3D space.
* Reacting to actor collision.
* Using Timers to repeatedly do things.
* Using Functions to encapsulate a bunch of reusable code.
* Using public variables and the construction script to alter blueprints from the Level Editor.

Levels:
* Lean (HW_Lean)
  * Inspire the viewer to lean in for better perspective.
* Dip (HW_Dip)
  * Inspire the viewer to dip, dodge, duck, dive, and/or dodge.
* Left (HW_Left)
  * Inspire the user to look left/right or up/down repeatedly.
